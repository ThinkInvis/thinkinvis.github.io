## Notes
- Some libraries by other authors are included in this project's files, with their own licenses separate from this project's license. Each library is in its own subdirectory within the 'lib' directory; if any such library does not contain an obvious reference to its own license, a copy of the relevant license (filename 'LICENSE', no extension, where possible) will be included within its subdirectory.
